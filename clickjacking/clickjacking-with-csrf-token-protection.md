- Solution:
- Explanation: Clickjacking
  - Malicious website is shown to a user with an overlaid layer using the CSS `z-index` property and an `opacity` of almost 0
  - This layer is what the user will actually interact with, when really they think theyâ€™re interacting with the visible, lower layer that looks like a legitimate website
